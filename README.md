# Python 3 package template

The package demonstrates how a python 3 package can be structured. In addition, 
it is already configured with the necessary Visual Studio Code launch, lint,
and format configurations.

The template uses:

* [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf)
* [pylint](https://www.pylint.org)

The configuration of yapf (.style.yapf) is set to google with two-space indent. It matches the google style conventions defined in .pylintrc. They are taken from <https://github.com/vinitkumar/googlecl/blob/master/googlecl-pylint.rc> and slightly modified to allow two-character variables and function arguments.


## Recommendations

### Use the launch configuration "Python test" to debug tests

The build-in test discovery of the python module is quite flaky at this time. Opposed to that, the "Run all unit tests" functionality works quite well and the status message gives and indication of the stability. A good idea is to map a key to run all test, for instance as:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+r",
  "command": "python.runtests"
}
```
